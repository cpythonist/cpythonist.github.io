        <h3>Other Projects</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
My other projects are published here (other than Second). I publish my major project (Second) separately and other projects in a group.
Other works of mine include the Tic-Tac-Toe project. I would also like to say that I work primarily on command-line applications. That 
is because I am not interested in GUI development yet and I also haven't learned and practised anything on developing GUIs. I would 
certainly do that in future as GUI development is also a core part in app development for user-friendly interfaces.

        <h4>Tic-Tac-Toe Player vs Computer Python Program</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
The link to download the source code is available <a href="ticTacToe/ticTacToe.html" class="linkWithoutTextDec">here</a>. Unfortunately, this program is not very 
much developed to be compiled and distributed as an executable. Therefore, users themselves have to run the file and compile (or freeze), 
if necessary.
